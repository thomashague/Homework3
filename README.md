# Python Pandas

This project taught me how to use Python's most popular data analysis library, Pandas, to answer questions about customers of a video game company. The goal was to produce a report that revealed customer characteristics and purchasing patterns. Based on these findings, the company could then adjust it's marketing, product offerings, design, and more.

Along with Pandas, I learned how to use Jupyter notebook, a tool that allows me to create and run python code incrementally. In other words, I can run pieces of my python code rather than having to run the whole file. This is good because errors in other sections of the code won't affect what you're trying to test. 

The data was provided in json format.
